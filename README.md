# Practical Machine Learning - Assignment

Coursera Data Science Specialization

## Background

Using devices such as Jawbone Up, Nike FuelBand, and Fitbit, it is now possible to collect a large amount of data about personal activity relatively inexpensively. These type of devices are part of the quantified self-movement - a group of enthusiasts who take measurements about themselves regularly to improve their health, to find patterns in their behavior, or because they are tech geeks. 

One thing that people regularly do is quantify how much of a particular activity they do, but they rarely quantify how well they do it. In this project, the goal is to use data from accelerometers on the belt, forearm, arm, and dumbell of 6 participants. They were asked to perform barbell lifts correctly and incorrectly in 5 different ways.

The test data for this project are available [here] (https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/predmachlearn/pml-testing.csv)

## Project Goal

The goal of the project is to predict the manner in which testers did the exercise in the study, the "classe" variable, using any of the variables available and with the model determined to have the lowest Out of Sample error.
